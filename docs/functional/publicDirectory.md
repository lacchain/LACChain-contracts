# Public Directory

This public directory holds minimal **public** identification data about entities. Data contained in this directory can then be used to identify entities that participate in certain contexts like collaborative project accross independent public/private institutions.

At a higher level, updates of this directory is subject to approval by a committee that includes the different organizations that have to reach a consensus to make any changes. This contract is thus a pillar on top of which trust can be built where participants acknowledge the committee to make changes and take these as valid.

## Terminology

## Base Considerations

- Among others, key data like Decentralized indentifiers [DIDs](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) are stored for every entity.
- One entity can have multiple DIDs.

## Smart Contract Considerations

- Every entity is assigned a unique identifier autogenerated by the contract when a member is added; so this can be used between the different Dids and the public entity data. This allows any participant to know a transparent history about the different states an entity registered in the public directory has gone through since it was registered.
